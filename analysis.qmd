## Overview

This doc runs the analysis scripts and reports the results for the data from people with Parkinsonâ€™s (PwP) and health age-matched controls (HCs).\
Each section sources a dedicated R script from the `scripts/` folder.

## Setup

When you click the **Render** button a document will be generated that includes both content and the output of embedded code. You can embed code like this:

```{r}
# Load packages
library(tidyverse)
library(janitor)
library(here)

# Define paths
raw_data_dir <- here("raw_data")
tidied_data_dir <- here("tidied_data")
scripts_dir <- here("scripts")
plots_dir <- here("plots")
```
